## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example
directory first.

### Measuring a View

To find out the dimensions of a view on your device, use one of the following
methods:

* `IRLSize size = [myView irl_dimensions];`
* `float widthInMeters = [myView irl_width];`
* `float heightInMeters = [myView irl_height];`

If a view is not on the primary screen (i.e. if youâ€™re using an external display)
the size will always be returned as 0, 0.

### Sizing a View

If you want to ensure that a view matches a certain physical size, IRLSize provides
transforms to help you out:

```Objective-C
myView.transform = [myView irl_transformForHeight:0.038];
```

### Measuring a Device

If you just want to know the physical size of the screen, use the category on
UIDevice:

```Swift
let screenHeightInMeters = UIDevice.currentDevice().irl_deviceHeight
```

## Installation

IRLSize is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "IRLSize"
